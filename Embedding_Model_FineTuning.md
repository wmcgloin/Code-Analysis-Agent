# **Project Assignment: Fine-Tune an Embeddings Model and Show Retrieval Accuracy Improvements**


---

## **1\. Project Overview**

In this project, you will fine-tune an **embeddings model** on **domain-specific data** from the **r/cisco** subreddit, which focuses on networking and telecommunications. The goal is to **improve retrieval accuracy** for domain-specific queries by adapting the model to the language and terminology used in networking discussions.

You will compare retrieval performance **before and after fine-tuning** using **key retrieval metrics** such as:

* **Normalized Reciprocal Rank (NRR)**  
* **Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)**  
* **Mean Average Precision (MAP)**

Additionally, you will:  
‚úÖ **Create a custom dataset** of networking-related questions to evaluate retrieval improvements.  
‚úÖ **Build a RAG-based demo application** (using **Streamlit, Chainlit, or a similar tool**) to showcase the improvements in real-time retrieval.  
‚úÖ **Demonstrate before/after results** in your evaluation.

For reference, you can use **LlamaIndex's embedding fine-tuning guide**:

## **2\. Data Collection & Preprocessing**

The training data is available in **an S3 bucket**:  
üìå **s3://bigdatateaching/reddit-project/reddit/parquet/**

### **A. Extracting Domain-Specific Data**

* **Filter for posts from the r/cisco subreddit.**  
* Extract **post titles, body text, and relevant comments** as training data.  
* Perform **text cleaning** (removing noise, links, formatting issues).  
* Generate **training pairs** (e.g., question-answer or context-relevant response pairs).

### **B. Creating an Evaluation Dataset**

* **Manually curate a set of networking-related queries** that resemble real-world search behavior.  
* These should include:  
  * General networking questions (e.g., *‚ÄúWhat is the best firewall for small businesses?‚Äù*).  
  * Cisco-specific queries (e.g., *‚ÄúHow to configure VLANs on a Cisco switch?‚Äù*).  
  * Multi-step troubleshooting questions (e.g., *‚ÄúWhy is my BGP session not establishing?‚Äù*).

This dataset will be used to **evaluate retrieval accuracy before and after fine-tuning**.

## **3\. Technical Components & Implementation**

### **A. Baseline Retrieval (Before Fine-Tuning)**

* Use **a pre-trained embeddings model** (e.g., **Nomic, BAAI-bge, or similar**) to compute vector embeddings.  
* Store embeddings in a **vector database** (FAISS, Weaviate, Pinecone, Chroma).  
* Run **initial retrieval tests** using BM25 \+ embeddings-based search.  
* Compute baseline retrieval metrics (**NRR, NDCG, MAP**).

### **B. Fine-Tuning the Embeddings Model**

* Train the model using **domain-specific Reddit data** from **r/cisco**.  
* Use contrastive learning or fine-tuning techniques from **LlamaIndex's fine-tuning guide**.  
* Save the **fine-tuned embeddings model** for evaluation.

### **C. Evaluation & Comparison**

* **Recompute vector embeddings** using the fine-tuned model.  
* Perform **retrieval on the evaluation dataset**.  
* Compare **before vs. after** performance using:  
  * **NRR (Normalized Reciprocal Rank)** ‚Äì How well does the top-ranked result match?  
  * **NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain)** ‚Äì How well are relevant results ranked?  
  * **MAP (Mean Average Precision)** ‚Äì Does retrieval improve across multiple queries?

### **D. Building a RAG-Based Demo Application**

* **Develop a simple UI (Streamlit, Chainlit, etc.)** to interact with the system.  
* Allow users to:  
  * Enter a **query** and see **retrieved results** before/after fine-tuning.  
  * Compare **search rankings, scores, and retrieved document snippets**.  
  * View retrieval statistics (**NRR, NDCG, MAP scores**).

### **E. Deployment**

* Deploy the solution **locally or on a cloud service** (AWS, Hugging Face Spaces, or a Flask-based API).

## **4\. Evaluation & Success Metrics**

### **A. Embedding Model Performance**

* Fine-tuning **successfully improves retrieval performance** compared to the baseline.  
* Results show improvements in **NRR, NDCG, and MAP scores**.

### **B. Evaluation Dataset & Analysis **

* **Retrieval accuracy comparisons** before and after fine-tuning are presented.

### **C. RAG Demo Application **

* A **working RAG-based app** (Streamlit, Chainlit, etc.) is developed.  
* Users can **query the system, see retrieved documents, and compare performance**.

### **D. Extra Credit **

* Additional **analysis on retrieval patterns**, fine-tuning challenges, or alternative embedding models.

### **E. Success Metrics**

* **Higher NRR/NDCG/MAP scores** after fine-tuning.  
* **More relevant documents retrieved** based on human evaluation.  
* **User study or feedback** (if possible) to validate improvements.
