# **Project Assignment: Question-Answering Slackbot for a DSAN Slack Channel**

---

## **1\. Project Overview**

In this project, you will build a **Question-Answering Slackbot** that can assist users in a DSAN (Data Science and AI) Slack workspace by providing intelligent, context-aware responses based on **Slack conversation history**.

Your solution must be **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based**, leveraging **multiple advanced RAG techniques** to improve retrieval accuracy and answer relevance. You will deploy your Slackbot **within a Slack channel**, allowing users to interact with it seamlessly.

You will be provided with **anonymized Slack data**, but you may also generate **synthetic Slack conversations** (extra credit) in Slack's JSON format to ensure robustness.

---

## **2\. A Note on Synthetic Data**

If you choose to generate **synthetic Slack data**, it should:

* **Follow Slack's JSON format** so that your solution is compatible with real Slack exports.  
* **Mimic real-world conversations** around data science, AI, and relevant topics.  
* **Include diverse query patterns**, such as follow-ups, ambiguous questions, and references to past discussions.

This synthetic data will help test and fine-tune your bot's response quality in various scenarios.

*ðŸ“Œ Extra Credit: **Additional points** for generating high-quality synthetic Slack data.*

---

## **3\. Technical Components & Implementation**

Your solution should consist of the following key components:

### **A. Data Processing & Storage**

* Load and preprocess **Slack JSON data** (real or synthetic).  
* Identify **message threads**, metadata (timestamps, user references), and structure the data for retrieval.  
* Store processed data in a **vector database** (e.g., FAISS, Weaviate, Pinecone, or Chroma).

### **B. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline**

Your bot should implement **multiple RAG techniques** to enhance retrieval and response quality. **At least three of the following techniques are required**:

1. **Query Rewriting:**  
   * Rewriting user queries to improve retrieval accuracy.  
   * Example: "How do I use LangChain for document QA?" â†’ "LangChain document question answering implementation examples."  
2. **Query Decomposition:**  
   * Breaking down **complex questions** into smaller sub-queries for better retrieval.  
   * Example:  
     * "How do I use LlamaIndex with a knowledge graph and fine-tuning?"  
     * â†’ Split into:  
       1. "How does LlamaIndex work with knowledge graphs?"  
       2. "How to fine-tune a retrieval model?"  
3. **Graph RAG:**  
   * Building **a knowledge graph** from Slack data (e.g., connecting concepts, FAQs, or recurring topics).  
   * Using **graph-based retrieval** instead of just keyword-based search.  
4. **Ensemble Retriever:**  
   * Using **multiple retrievers** (e.g., **dense vector search \+ BM25**) to improve recall.  
   * Combining results using ranking or fusion techniques.  
5. **Hybrid Search (Dense \+ Sparse Retrieval):**  
   * Combining **vector embeddings (semantic search)** with **keyword-based BM25 retrieval** to improve search results.

### **C. Slackbot Integration**

* Implement a **Slack app** using Slackâ€™s API and event handling.  
* Handle **real-time user queries** and return responses from your RAG pipeline.  
* Ensure **multi-turn conversation support** (the bot should remember context within a thread).  
* Allow **user feedback collection** (e.g., thumbs up/down for responses).

### **D. Deployment**

* Deploy the bot using **a cloud or local environment** (e.g., AWS Lambda, FastAPI, or a Flask-based server).  
* Ensure **secure API integration** with Slack.

## **4\. Evaluation & Success Metrics**

### **A. Core Functionality**

* Slackbot **correctly retrieves and answers** user questions based on Slack data.  
* Responses are **coherent, contextually relevant, and factually correct**.

### **B. RAG Techniques **

* Uses **at least three advanced RAG techniques** from the list.  
* Effectiveness of retrieval and response generation improves with these techniques.

### **C. Slackbot Integration**

* Bot is **fully functional in Slack** with real-time interaction.  
* Supports **multi-turn conversations** and context tracking.

### **D. Extra Credit**

* High-quality **synthetic Slack data** is generated in JSON format.  
* Synthetic data improves **bot performance on edge cases**.

### **E. Success Metrics**

Your project will be evaluated based on:

* **Response Accuracy:** Does the bot return relevant and correct answers?  
* **Retrieval Efficiency:** Are the retrieved documents and Slack messages useful?  
* **User Interaction Quality:** Does the bot handle follow-ups and ambiguous queries well?
