# DSAN 6725 final project

This repository contains information about deliverables, project ideas and all things related to the final project.


## Overview

DSAN 6725 is an applied AI course, while the focus is on building useful things with AI but more foundational work on benchmarking, fine-tuning, optimization strategies for inference, exploration of newer open-source frameworks for building applications and so on and so forth is highly encouraged.

The is repo provides some project ideas but you are not limited to just these, you can explore other ideas but it would be incumbent upon you (your team) to discuss these ideas and get approval before proceeding. The ideas suggested here are practically useful, of course there are hundreds of others ideas which are probably even more useful, so explore more by all means but we do want to lock down on a project idea which has a reasonable chance of success in 6-weeks give or take so please keep that in mind.

This repo is organized into the following parts:

- [Project ideas](#project-ideas)
- [Deliverables](#deliverables)
- [FAQ](#faq)
- [Resources](#resources)

## Project Ideas

**NOTE**: These project ideas have well-defined problem statements, but the implementation details are flexible and open to creative solutions. Use the description provided for each of these projects as springboards for your own ways to solve these problems.

## FAQ

`Question`: Can I do this project alone as a single person team? Can there be more than 4 people in a team?<br>
`Answer`: No and no.

`Question`: Can I use OpenAI for my project?<br>
`Answer`: You have a paid plan for their API, go for it. In this class though we won't be covering it.

`Question`: Can I use generative AI to help me with my project?<br>
`Answer`: If you want to use it in a non-substantial way then yes, see [this section](https://gu-dsan.github.io/6725-spring-2025/syllabus.html#use-of-generative-ai-tools) from the syllabus. As I have always stated in the class that if you use it as a productivity assistant then yes, if you use it do your work then _A) you learn nothing and B) this is considered plagiarism_.
