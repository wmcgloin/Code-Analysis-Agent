### **Gen AI AI-Powered Code Refactoring & Dependency Updater**

#### **Project Overview**

Maintaining large codebases is challenging due to **outdated dependencies, code quality issues, and evolving best practices**. This project explores how **Generative AI can automate code refactoring, dependency management, and testing**, making software maintenance more efficient.

The goal is to build an **AI-powered software engineering agent** that:

1. **Clones an existing GitHub repository** and processes it for analysis.  
2. **Reviews code quality**, suggesting improvements based on best practices.  
3. **Refactors and modernizes the code**, ensuring consistency across functions and files.  
4. **Updates dependencies** by reading `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt`, identifying outdated packages, and upgrading them to their latest stable versions.  
5. **Ensures compatibility** by testing the refactored code and verifying dependency upgrades.  
6. **Uses multi-agent collaboration** to divide tasks efficiently (e.g., code review, refactoring, testing).

By leveraging **LLMs, code analysis tools, and multi-agent collaboration**, this project automates the process of improving a software repository with minimal human intervention.

### **Why Synthetic Data?**

To evaluate the **robustness and correctness** of the AI agent, we will create **synthetic repositories** with:

* **Intentional code smells** (e.g., duplicate code, unused variables, poor error handling).  
* **Outdated dependencies** to test automatic upgrades.  
* **Messy project structures** to test file organization improvements.

**_Note that the following is simply an example of poor code to unit test your solution, once you have a solution you need to showcase it working on [AWS FMBench Orchestrator](https://github.com/awslabs/fmbench-orchestrator) repo. You can fork this repo, have your agent work on it and submit a PR once you have tested the new and improved code written by your agent_**.

Example synthetic repo files:

#### **1\. Python Code with Outdated Practices**

ðŸ“„ `app.py`

python  
CopyEdit  
`import requests  # Older version, missing timeout`  
`import json`

`def fetch_data(url):`  
    `response = requests.get(url)  # No error handling`  
    `return json.loads(response.text)`

`print(fetch_data("https://api.example.com/data"))`

**Issues:**

* No timeout in `requests.get()`.  
* No exception handling.  
* Outdated `requests` version.

#### **2\. Old Dependency File**

ðŸ“„ `requirements.txt`

txt  
CopyEdit  
`requests==2.22.0`  
`numpy==1.18.5`  
`flask==1.1.1`

**Task:**

* Find the latest versions and update them.

#### **3\. Complex Codebase with Poor Structure**

Multiple files with inconsistent coding styles, missing docstrings, and unused functions.

### **Technical Components & Implementation**

1. **Multi-Agent System for Code Analysis & Refactoring**  
   * **Agent 1 (Code Review Agent):** Analyzes code quality, suggests improvements.  
   * **Agent 2 (Refactoring Agent):** Rewrites functions to improve maintainability.  
   * **Agent 3 (Dependency Updater):** Reads dependency files, finds updates, and modifies them.  
   * **Agent 4 (Testing Agent):** Runs unit tests to ensure compatibility after changes.  
2. **Code Analysis & Modernization**  
   * Use **LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Code Llama, DeepSeekCoder)** for **automatic code improvement**.  
   * Refactor for **better readability, efficiency, and security**.  
   * Maintain **functionality across refactored files**.  
3. **Dependency Management & Upgrades**  
   * Read `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`.  
   * Query the latest versions using **PyPI APIs**.  
   * Upgrade dependencies, check for **breaking changes**, and adjust code accordingly.  
4. **Testing & Validation**  
   * Run **unit tests before and after** code changes.  
   * Generate synthetic test cases for new functions.  
   * Verify that all upgraded dependencies work correctly.

### **Evaluation & Success Metrics**

* **Reduction in technical debt** (e.g., code complexity scores).  
* **Correctness of dependency upgrades** (e.g., successful package builds).  
* **Improved maintainability** (e.g., adherence to PEP 8, linting scores).  
* **Successful test execution** post-refactoring.
