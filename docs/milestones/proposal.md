# Enhancing Code Comprehension with AI-Driven Logic Flow Mapping

Understanding the structure and logic of large code repositories is a challenge for developers, especially in complex or unfamiliar projects. We propose a Generative AI-powered Code Visualization Agent that extracts high-level logical relationships between files, generating interpretable logic flow diagrams and mind maps rather than simple function call graphs. Unlike existing runtime-based tools, our system will leverage LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Cypher-based graph querying to provide context-aware, interactive insights into repository architecture. Our agent empowers developers to jumpstart their understanding of the codebase through both visual representations and natural language queries. To handle large-scale repositories, we will implement efficient retrieval mechanisms, ensuring scalability while maintaining interpretability. While we will start with Python, our approach aims to be language-agnostic, adapting to different programming paradigms. By bridging the gap between static analysis and human comprehension, our tool enhances code maintainability, collaboration, and decision-making in software development.

### EXAMPLE: 
1. User inputs a repository
1. System parses the codebase, identifying files, functions, classes, and dependencies
1. LLM analyzes high-level logical relationships, extracting module interactions and reasoning behind structures
1. Graph-based visualization is generated, displaying a logic flow diagram or mind map of the repository
1. User interacts with the system, querying dependencies or specific relationships
1. RAG model retrieves relevant code sections for deeper insights in large repositories
1. Cypher-based graph queries enhance interpretability, allowing structured exploration
1. User gains a clearer understanding of the repository, aiding comprehension, collaboration, and maintainability
