# Milestone 3: Router Implementation and Interface Development

## Overview

In this milestone, we've focused on implementing a functional router system and developing our preliminary user interface. Building on our previous work with data preparation and RAG implementation, we've successfully created a modular routing mechanism using LangChain that serves as the core supervisor for our code analysis tool. This router analyzes user queries about code repositories and intelligently routes them to specialized agents depending on whether the query requires detailed structure analysis or high-level conceptual understanding.

## Router Implementation

Our supervisor agent now effectively coordinates between two specialized analysis pipelines. The micro agent handles detailed semantic relationships at the function, method, and class level, while the macro agent processes high-level logical relationships between components, modules, and architectural concepts. Each agent maintains dedicated tools for retrieving relevant information and generating insights, with access to both graph and vector databases as appropriate for their analysis tasks.

## Frontend Development

We've implemented Streamlit as our frontend framework, providing a lightweight yet powerful interface for interacting with our code analysis system. The current implementation includes a simple mechanism for inputting GitHub repository URLs, status indicators for the preprocessing pipeline, and a query input for asking questions about the codebase. It will also include an integrated display for both visualizations and textual explanations, creating a seamless experience where users can easily explore code relationships without needing to navigate between different interfaces.

## Visualization Capabilities

Our visualization capabilities have significantly improved with the integration of PyVis and NetworkX for interactive graph rendering. We've implemented styling based on node types, added informative tooltips, and created legends to help users understand the different components of the generated graphs. These visualizations will be embedded directly within the Streamlit interface, making it easier for users to interpret and interact with the code relationship diagrams.

## Technical Infrastructure

We've developed several tools for our agents to use when analyzing code, including repository cloning and file processing utilities, graph and vector database querying functions, and visualization generation capabilities. We've also implemented a comprehensive logging system that tracks query processing, agent activities, database interactions, and preprocessing steps. This infrastructure provides valuable insights for debugging and future optimization efforts.

## Next Steps

As we move forward, we'll focus on refining the user experience, enhancing analysis accuracy, expanding visualization options, implementing repository caching, and introducing guardrails to safeguard our agent from potential abuse. While there is still work to be done, the core architecture is now in place, and we're well-positioned to continue developing a valuable tool for code understanding and exploration.
